# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I chose to enroll in this bootcamp beacuse I saw it as a new opportunity and challenge to learn and gain knowledge in web development.
I was always passionate about the new technologies and foreign languages. For me the HTML, CSS and JavaScript can be compared to a foreign language: HTML is the alphabet, CSS can be compared to the methaphors which embellish the language and JavaScript is the grammar.
I have assimilated so much during this prework courses like for example: the structure of HTML and how to style my webpage, I also learnt what is JavaScript and its role in the webpage and how to declare a variable, a function and how to check the outcome in the console.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

HTML contains the structure of it: head and body
With CSS we can style and embellish our webpage using the CSS selectors: id and classes. I have learnt how to link an external CSS sheet in the HTML head because this is metadata information and it is not visible to the user.
Finally, I have learnt about JavaScript how to declare a variable using "var", how to create and use arrays, how to loop through an array using for loops and how to create a function. I also learnt about primitive data types which are strings, numbers and boolean values.
I learnt about GIT and its commands which I have used them in Git Bash, how to create new branches, how to synchronize my local work with the remote Git project and how to add my changes here.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
